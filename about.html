	Born in Ottawa, James Erdeg earned a BFA Photo from the University of Ottawa in 1998. Working primarily with a 35mm point and shoot film camera and 			occasionally a phone, James' photos of everyday scenes often appear to be random or haphazard with an emphasis on lighting and composition that renders the commonplace scenes poetic maybe even romantic. The first picture he took at age three was of his spiderman action figure sitting in a toy car, his most recent was of spilled tea that resembled a skull . James has had work in exhibitions in exotic locales such as Ottawa, Montreal, Paris, New York, Tokyo, London, Mexico City and even Oshkosh Wisconsin, St. Louis and Kansas City and has also exhibited extensively in Ottawa with shows at Gallery 101, La Petite Mort, Festival X and Chinatown Remixed.
